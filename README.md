JavaScript by Brandon Rowe

Thank you for reviewing my project!!

I am going for exceeds expectations. As a result:

1. a search bar has been added to filter employee directory by name.
2. a way to toggle back and forth between employees when the modal window is open has been added.
3. alterations to the styles.css were made including changing the background color of the body element as well as changing the font color of the card name and card text.

Thanks again for your time, expertise and feedback.

Best,
Brandon
