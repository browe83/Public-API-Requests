## About
This project builds an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. It requests a JSON object from the API and parses the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.  The left-hand image shows the initial display of 12 employes, while the right-hand displays an example of the modal window.
